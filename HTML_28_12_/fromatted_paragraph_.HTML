  <p><abbr title="">HTML</abbr>" elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
    HTML provides a means to create Structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as <b> headlings,paragraphs,lists,quotes and other items.</b>
    HTML elements are delineated by tags,written using <u>angle brackets.</u> such as &lt;img/&gt; and &lt;input/&gt; directly introduce content into the page.
   <br> Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
   <br> Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
